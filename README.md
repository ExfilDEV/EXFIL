# What is this?
This is a remake of EXFIL, a ROBLOX game me and my team were making. (Obviously, we switched to Unity instead.)
### Yeah, but what is EXFIL?
EXFIL was originally a ROBLOX version of Escape from Tarkov, but has now evolved into a Unity game/project. EXFIL will be a singleplayer FPS extraction game with realistic and big landscapes and an interesting story, however, most of it is in development.

**Anything shown here is not final, and we can change it at any time.**
