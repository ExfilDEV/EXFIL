# What is this?
This is a port/remake of EXFIL, a ROBLOX game me and my team were making. (Obviously, we switched to Unity instead.) The entire game is going to be changed, and it will be a LOT more interesting and fun.
### What is EXFIL?
EXFIL was originally a ROBLOX version of Escape from Tarkov, but has now evolved into a Unity game/project. EXFIL will be a singleplayer FPS extraction game with realistic and big landscapes and an interesting story, however, most of it is in development.

**Anything shown here is not final, and we can change it at any time.**

# Roadmap
Our roadmap is currently under the developer-only section, however we have a public version, found here: https://github.com/orgs/ExfilDEV/projects/3

The public version will be updated less than the beta or developer versions.
Teasers are posted on the MissinginAction discord server, check the description of the repository or orginization to join.

# Beta Testing
Beta testing is only available for certain members, but please DM me on discord @ missinginaction#0001 if you would like to apply.
